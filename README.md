# N3D-Video-Demo

You can add videos in the directory video and change your title and description in the class ```MainViewController```:

```
let videoTitleArray = ["Captain American", "Maroon5", "Star Wars"]
let videoDescriptionArray = ["Ironman comes! Everybody out!",
                             "what lovers do",
                             "star war trailer"]
```
These videos will be ordered by the duration descendingly.
